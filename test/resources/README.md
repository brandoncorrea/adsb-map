## aircraft-sample.json

A genuine `aircraft.json` payload captured from the live ultrafeeder
(`http://dietpi.local:8100/data/aircraft.json`) on **2026-07-11**, selected as the
richest of 10 captures polled at ~25-second intervals. It is a real recording,
warts included — space-padded callsigns, aircraft with no `lat`/`lon`, absent
`gs`/`track`/`baro_rate`, string `squawk` values (including leading zeros) — and
must stay that way. Do not pretty-print, trim, normalize, or "fix" it; the whole
point of the fixture is that it is what the feeder actually sends
(see `docs/validation-boundaries.md`).

### Privacy redaction

The receiver's location is private. The following fields were **removed from every
aircraft** before committing, because they reveal the receiver's position (each is
the aircraft's distance/bearing measured from the receiver, so two or three of them
triangulate the antenna):

- `r_dst` — distance from the receiver, in nautical miles
- `r_dir` — bearing from the receiver, in degrees

No other bytes were altered: the redaction was performed by textual removal of the
`"r_dst":<value>` / `"r_dir":<value>` pairs only, and the result was verified to be
JSON-equal to the original minus exactly those keys. The capture contained no other
receiver-position fields (no receiver lat/lon appears in `aircraft.json`; the
`lastPosition` object is the *aircraft's* stale position, not the receiver's).

### Quirks present in this fixture (verified against the live capture set)

| Quirk | Status in captures |
|---|---|
| `alt_baro` is a number | confirmed |
| `alt_baro` is the string `"ground"` | not observed in this capture window (claim stands; see doc) |
| `lat`/`lon` absent entirely | confirmed |
| `flight` space-padded to 8 chars | confirmed |
| `flight` absent | confirmed |
| `hex` with `~` prefix (TIS-B/ADS-R) | not observed in this capture window |
| `squawk` as 4-digit string, leading zeros preserved | confirmed |
| `gs`/`track`/`baro_rate` absent | confirmed |
| explicit `null` values | not observed in this capture window |
| `alt_baro` itself absent (bare `mode_s` targets) | confirmed (not in the doc table, but real) |

"Not observed" means the quirk did not occur during this ten-poll window — the doc's
claim that it *can* occur stands. Ingest must still handle those cases; this fixture
alone does not exercise them.

## receiver-sample.json

A `receiver.json` response in the live feeder's exact shape (readsb: top-level
`lat`/`lon` beside `refresh`/`history`/`version`), verified against the real
feeder on **2026-07-11** — but with **synthetic coordinates**. The receiver's
real position is private (see `docs/validation-boundaries.md`); the committed
`lat`/`lon` are rounded stand-ins in the same general region as the
aircraft-sample positions, so the range gate behaves realistically in tests
without locating the antenna. The git hash in `version` is likewise zeroed.
Do not replace these with real coordinates.

## beast-sample.bin

**SYNTHETIC.** A Beast binary capture (ultrafeeder's port 30005 wire format)
**constructed from the framing spec, not recorded** — dietpi.local does not
resolve from the build machine and the feeder is never contacted (see
`docs/CLAUDE.md`: never test against a live feeder). It is built to exercise
`adsb.ingest.beast/frames` adversarially: one frame of each Beast type ('1'
Mode-A/C, '2' short Mode-S, '3' long Mode-S), a doubled-`0x1a` escape in the
MLAT, signal, and payload positions, pure junk and an escape-plus-bad-type run
between frames (resync), and a truncated final frame (carry).

The exact byte layout and a regenerator live in the `(comment ...)` at the
bottom of `test/clj/adsb/ingest/beast_test.clj`; the committed bytes are the
source of truth the tests read. To be **superseded or augmented by a real
capture** off the feeder — tracked as bead **adsb-c75**. Beast carries no
receiver-position field, so there is nothing to redact here today; a real
capture must be reviewed against `docs/validation-boundaries.md` before it
lands.

## sbs-sample.txt

**SYNTHETIC.** An SBS BaseStation capture (ultrafeeder's port 30003 wire
format) **constructed from the documented CSV format, not recorded** —
dietpi.local does not resolve from the build machine and the feeder is never
contacted (see `docs/CLAUDE.md`: never test against a live feeder). Each line
is one Mode-S message: comma-separated, 22 positional fields, most empty.

It is built to exercise `adsb.ingest.sbs/line->delta` and the SBS Source
adversarially. Two aircraft accumulate across several messages each
(`a1b2c3`: a padded callsign, then an airborne position + altitude, a
velocity, and an emergency squawk; `abcdef`: an on-ground flag, then a
position), proving fields from separate lines fold into one track. The rest
are hostile or degenerate and must all be dropped or partially coerced at the
boundary: a MSG,1 space-padded callsign, empty positional fields throughout, a
pure garbage line, a non-MSG class line (`STA`, ignored), a truncated line
carrying only a valid ICAO, a line with an empty ICAO (dropped — the
accumulator keys on identity), and an out-of-range latitude (the position is
dropped, the altitude kept — a bad field costs the field, never the aircraft;
`docs/validation-boundaries.md`).

SBS carries no receiver-position field (no `r_dst`/`r_dir`), so there is
nothing to redact here. To be **superseded or augmented by a real capture**
off the feeder — tracked as bead **adsb-c75** — which must be reviewed
against `docs/validation-boundaries.md` before it lands.

## sbs-capture-2026-07-14.txt

A genuine SBS BaseStation capture — ~30 seconds of ultrafeeder's port 30003
recorded on **2026-07-14** over the Access-gated Cloudflare Tunnel
(`wss://sbs.bwawan.com`, service-token auth; the websocket leg was unwrapped,
the payload bytes are untouched). This is the real capture bead **adsb-c75**
called for. It is what the feeder actually sent, warts included — do not
trim, sort, or normalize it. 1,857 lines, all `MSG` class, transmission types
1/3/4/5/6/7/8, 22 positional fields per line, 33 distinct aircraft.

Reviewed per `docs/validation-boundaries.md` before landing: every line was
verified to be a 22-field `MSG` row; SBS carries no receiver-position field
(no `r_dst`/`r_dir` equivalents), so nothing was redacted. Aircraft positions
are retained, exactly as in `aircraft-sample.json`.

Replayed by `test/clj/adsb/ingest/capture_replay_test.clj`, which pins the
boundary's exact behavior against these frozen bytes.

## beast-capture-2026-07-14.bin

A genuine Beast binary capture — ~30 seconds of ultrafeeder's port 30005,
recorded on **2026-07-14** the same way as `sbs-capture-2026-07-14.txt`
above (same tunnel, same session, same sky). Real escapes, real 12 MHz MLAT
timestamps, real radio noise: 5 Mode-A/C frames, 2,809 short and 1,791 long
Mode-S frames, of which 48 long frames fail CRC-24 or are not DF17/18 —
kept deliberately, because dropping them at the boundary is the point.

Beast frames carry aircraft Mode-S payloads, MLAT counter values, and signal
levels — no receiver-position field; nothing was redacted. Replayed by
`test/clj/adsb/ingest/capture_replay_test.clj`.

## Beast Source end-to-end frames (no committed file)

**SYNTHETIC-from-published-vectors.** The Beast Source integration test
(`test/clj/adsb/ingest/beast_source_test.clj`) does not read a committed
binary; it **builds its wire bytes in-process** by wrapping mode-s.org's
published known-answer Mode-S vectors — the same ones the mode-s decode
tests pin (KLM1023 identification, and the even/odd airborne-position pair
that decodes to 52.2572/3.91937 at 38000 ft) — in Beast framing (`0x1a` +
type + 6-byte MLAT + signal + payload, doubling any `0x1a`). The stream is
adversarial: pure junk, a Mode-A/C and a short Mode-S frame the Source must
ignore, a corrupted-CRC frame that must leave no trace, and an
escape+bad-type resync run, served in small flushed chunks so frames split
across socket reads (exercising `:carry` reassembly). See the framing
fixture `beast-sample.bin` above for the unit-level capture. To be
**superseded or augmented by a real capture** off the feeder — tracked as
bead **adsb-c75** — which must be reviewed against
`docs/validation-boundaries.md` before it lands. Beast carries no
receiver-position field, so there is nothing to redact.
